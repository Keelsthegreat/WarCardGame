# Instructions 
Players turn over the top card of their deck and present it for "battle". Cards rank from 2 (lowest) to Ace (highest). Whoever turned over the higher valued card "captures" the opponents card and adds both cards face down to the bottom of their deck.The player that captures all the cards is the winner.

# Things to improve on / Things to add 
- Add a feature where you can draw 3 cards when tied and capture opponents cards.
- Add more animations to the game.
